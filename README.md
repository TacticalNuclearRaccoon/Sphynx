# Sphynx
gpt3 based streamlit app that asks dichotomic questions

## The application

<br>
Sphynx asks dichotomic questions to diagnose a dysfunction. The user needs to write the dysfunction inside the text area and the question is prompted by the sphynx.

The input dysfunctions and the output questions are gathered as a dataframe that can be downloaded.

The link to the application is [here](https://tacticalnuclearraccoon-sphynx-app-ultkdb.streamlit.app/)

<br>

You will need an API key to use the app.

### Parameters:

**The temperature** : The risk that the model takes when asking the question. Temperature 0 means direct questions. Increased temperatures result in funkier questions. 

Good luck ^^'
